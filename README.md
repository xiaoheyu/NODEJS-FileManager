# Usage



```sh
  clone the repository
  cd node-file-manager
  npm i
  cd lib
  node --harmony index.js -p 8080 -d /path/to
```

We can run node-file-manager in terminal directly. We can specify prot add data root dir by `-p` and `-d`, default with 5000 and scripts directory.

Then, we can view localhost:8080/ in our browr. You can also open your port through ufw for public access.
